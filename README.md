# Project Description
Hi there, my name is Abdullah Ayman and I'm going to talk to you about how never to play against Teemo in bot lane.

This project constructs the robot function with animation to help you visualize how the robot moves in its designated working area. You enter the robot's parameters and then you can choose between a range of functionalities to h

# Instructions

1. Download or Clone the repository
2. Open **Draft1GUI.m** file.
3. Run it using MATLAB and play around ðŸ˜‹

# Use Cases

## First of all, enter the lengths of the two link and the range of each link then you can:

### Draw & calculate the working area with or without animation

### Use Direct Kinematics Position Model to deduce X & Y from given $\theta$~1~

### Use Inverse Kinematics Position Model to deduce angles from given X & Y

### Animate robotic arm along a straight line trajectory in working area

# Notes

- Before any calculation is done or a graph is drawn, the input values are validated to a certain accuracy to ensure valid calculations.
- Please wait for the animation to end before clicking another push button to perform another operation.
